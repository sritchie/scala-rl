  This implements policy evaluation, NO update for the policy itself. And I
  guess... that means that we should actually take a policy to evaluate.

  This assumes you get to:

  - See what comes next.
  - Have some categorical policy.

  If you DO know those things, this will give you the value of the current
  state.

  TODO note that this only lets you look forward a single step. We're going to
  want to be able to look forward many steps in the model, and create an algebra
  that will let us talk well about this.

  I made a note in StateValueFn about how we should probably split out the
  value function storage abstraction from the actual evaluator.
